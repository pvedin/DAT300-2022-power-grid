Since most of the third-party libraries used require their copyright notices to be reproduced for "use in ... binary forms, ... without modification", they have been included in this directory. For this module, these libraries are simply imported; it is the responsibility of the user to install these via e.g. `pip`.

Note that the licence for matplotlib is not included as its condition is that the copyright notice etc. "are retained in matplotlib alone": https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/LICENSE/LICENSE.
